<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p>Strong professionals.  Fun friends. Caring parents.  Reliable co-workers. Compassionate siblings.  Responsible bosses.  Loving partners.  Good people.
The list can goes on.  Our lives are filled with endless roles and what we do for others.  And we are constantly striving to be better at them.  
<br>But the realities of our endless roles mean there is just not enough time in the day.  Like everyone else, co-founders Mitzi and Cynthia, have felt this way.<br>On a journey for self-improvement, they tried looking for experts to help them.
<br>In this day and age, you would think this would be simple…wrong.  
<br>Yes, there are tons of sources that list professionals.  But they are fragmented.  And hard to compare.  Critical details like price and specialties are hard to gleen without putting in some serious research and back and forth phone calls.  When we learn some prices, we’re amazed at how expensive rates can be.  And in the end, we’re still left with the uncertainty if it will be the right fit.
<br>We knew there had to be a better way.
<p>
