<ol>
<p><strong>V. TRANSACTIONS</strong></p>
</ol>
<ol>
<strong><p> For Users</strong></p> 
</ol>
<p>Users may be given the opportunity to book the services of a Professional through the Platform.  In completing a booking, you will have the opportunity to agree upon the pricing, services and date with the Professional.  The price offered to you will be set by the Professional. Our service fee will be included in the price quoted to you by the Professional and, except as described in the following sentence, no additional charges will apply.  As part of your transaction, we may give you the opportunity to donate to a charity and/or to tip your Professional in advance.  If you choose to donate or tip (and we hope you will!), the amount of your donation and/or tip will be added to fee quoted to you. If you choose to add such additional payments, our service fee will not be calculated based on such additional amounts; the full amount of the tip and/or donation will be paid to the recipients less only transaction costs (e.g., credit card processing fees).</p>
<p>A booking will not be considered complete or secured until you confirm the booking and “check-out” authorizing payment.  Once you confirm the booking and authorize the charge, the full price, along with the booking fee, donation and tip (if any), will be immediately charged to the credit card even if your appointment is in the future.  We reserve the right to cancel any booking if the payment information provided is incorrect, denied or delayed. When you provide credit card information to us, you represent that you are the authorized user of the credit card.</p>
<p>Upon booking the service, we may provide your email and/or phone number to the applicable Professional and may provide you with the Professional’s contact information so you can contact each other if needed.  In addition, you can always reach your Professional through the secure messaging center if needed.  You expressly agree that you will only contact the Professional for purposes related to the booking.</p>
<ol>
<strong><p> For Professionals</strong></p> 
</ol>
<p>By creating an Account with the Platform, Professionals will be added to the network of Professionals made available to Users through the Platform.  As a Professional, Users will be given the ability to book your services. You will have the right to set your own terms related to the booking, including pricing and your cancellation policy.  You acknowledge and agree that we may charge you and retain a service fee of 15% of your fee for all bookings made through the Platform.  In addition, we have the right to deduct from the remainder of the sums due to you (including any tip a User has agreed to pay you) reasonable payment transaction costs (e.g., credit card processing fees).  You will not receive any sums donated to charity.  The amounts due to you hereunder will be paid to you the business day following the date of the applicable appointment which generated the fee.  You agree that we may act as your limited agent solely for the purpose of collecting the applicable fees you charge to the Users who book your services through the Platform.  Any payment received by us from a User through the Platform to book your services will be deemed a payment received by you.</p>
<p>Upon booking the service, we may provide your email and/or phone number to the applicable User and may provide you with the User’s contact information so you can contact each other if needed.  In addition, you can always reach the User through the secure messaging center if needed.  You expressly agree that you will only contact the User for purposes related to the booking.</p>

<ol>
<strong><p> Cancellations / Refunds </strong></p> 
</ol>
<p>Cancellation policies will be determined solely by the Professionals so please verify your Professional’s cancellation policy.  If you are a User and you cancel a booking, you agree that you will still be charged the applicable booking fee.  You further agree that if the relevant Professional’s cancellation policy requires you to pay some portion of the service fees related to the booking, you will be required to pay such fees.</p>


<ol>
<p><strong>VI. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US AND OUR USERS/PROFESSIONALS</strong></p>

The purchase, payment, warranty, guarantee, delivery, maintenance, and all other matters concerning the products, services or information, opinion or advice ordered or received from Professionals are solely between the User and such Professional. We do not endorse, sponsor, recommend any Professional on the Platform.  Without limiting the foregoing, we make no representations or warranties regarding the services of any Professional on the Platform, including with respect to the quality of their services, the reasonableness of their rates, that they will be available for any scheduled times or that they are properly licensed or permitted. Users are solely responsible for determining the suitability of any Professional they may find through the Platform.

<ol>

<p><strong> APPLICABLE LAW; JURISDICTION </strong>
</ol>

The arbitration proceedings shall be held and conducted by a single arbitrator in accordance with the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS (the “JAMS Rules”), as modified by this Agreement.  Such arbitration shall occur in Los Angeles, California, and be initiated by any party in accordance with the JAMS Rules.  The demand for arbitration shall be made by any party hereto within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute or other matter in question has arisen, and in any event shall not be made after the date when institution of legal proceeding, based on such claim, dispute or other matter in question, would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations.  Discovery issues shall be decided by the arbitrator.  Post-hearing briefs shall be permitted.  The arbitrator shall render a decision within twenty (20) days after the conclusion of the hearing(s).  In reaching a decision, the arbitrator shall have no authority to change, extend, modify or suspend any of the terms of this Agreement, or to grant an award or remedy any greater than that which would be available from a court under the statutory or common law theory asserted.  The arbitrator shall issue a written opinion that includes the factual and legal basis for any decision and award.  The arbitrator shall apply the substantive law (and the law of remedies, if applicable) of California or federal law, or any of them, as applicable to the claim(s) asserted.  Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.  The parties may seek, from a court of competent jurisdiction, provisional remedies or injunctive relief in support of their respective rights and remedies hereunder without waiving any right to arbitration.  However, the merits of any action that involves such provisional remedies or injunctive relief, including, without limitation, the terms of any permanent injunction, shall be determined by arbitration under this paragraph.  Judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The arbitrator shall allocate all costs and expenses of the arbitration (including legal and accounting fees and expenses of the respective parties) to the parties in the proportions that reflect their relative success on the merits (including the successful assertion of any defenses).</p>
